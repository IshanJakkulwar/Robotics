Welcome to the official repository of our VEX Robotics team for the **VEX World Championship**! This repository contains the codebase for our competition robot, using the powerful **LemLib** motion planning library to achieve precise autonomous and driver control routines.

## 🚀 Overview

This code is optimized for performance, consistency, and adaptability in high-stakes matches. We leverage:
- **LemLib** for advanced path-following and turn control.
- **PathJerry** for visualizing and planning trajectories.
- Custom PID tuning for consistent performance on the field.

📸 Path Visualization

We have a visualisation of our autonomous paths, generated using PathJerry:


📍 This helps us debug and optimize our robot's trajectory in real time.

🔧 Requirements
VEXcode Pro V5

LemLib (included)

PathJerry for path planning (optional but recommended)
